How wonderful would it be, in a video call, to convey your meaning to the recipient by virtually writing on the screen! This ongoing project of mine tries to add this new functionality for video demonstrations. It includes:

• Extracting out frames from given videos and then pre-processing it using python libraries like sklearn to then ﬁt the frame inside the model. 

• Building and training a Deep Learning CNN model, using Keras framework, to track the location of a marker pen present in the frame. 

• Optimizing the algorithm and minimizing the size of the model, to enable real time tracking. 

• Future aspect of this project would be to convert this writing into text and use it to send messages
